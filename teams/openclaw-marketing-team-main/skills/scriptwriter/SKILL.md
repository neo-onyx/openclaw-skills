[13-15s] END CARD

## Hook Formulas

### Pattern Interrupt
> "If you're still [wrong behavior], you're [consequence]."

### Curiosity Gap
> "I [achieved result] and here's what nobody tells you..."

### Controversial Take
> "Stop [common advice]. Here's what actually works."

### Identity Call-Out
> "This is for [specific person] who [specific situation]..."

### Question Hook
> "Why do [surprising thing] when you could [better alternative]?"

### Result Lead
> "[Company] went from [before] to [after]. Here's how."

## On-Screen Text Guidelines

1. **Keep it short** — 3-5 words max per text element
2. **Reinforce, don't repeat** — Add to dialogue, don't duplicate
3. **Use hierarchy** — Important words bigger/bolder
4. **Time it right** — Appear with dialogue, not before
5. **Position consistently** — Same area throughout video

### Text Styles
```
EMPHASIS: All caps, bold
"Quote style": In quotation marks
Stat/number: Large, accent color
CTA: Arrow or emoji pointing (👇 ➡️)
```

## B-Roll Categories

### Screen Recordings
- Tool interfaces (ChatGPT, Make, etc.)
- Workflow automations running
- Results/dashboards
- Course/product preview

### Talking Head Variations
- Different angles (straight, 3/4)
- Different framings (tight, medium, wide)
- Gestures and reactions

### Stock/Generic
- Person working at laptop
- Team collaboration
- Frustration → success moments
- Abstract tech visuals

### Brand Specific
- Product screenshots
- Customer testimonials (clips)
- Behind-the-scenes
- Event footage

## Emotional Arcs

### TOFU (Awareness)
```
Frustration → Curiosity → Hope
"I'm stuck" → "Wait, what?" → "I could do this"
```

### MOFU (Consideration)
```
Skepticism → Understanding → Confidence
"Does this work?" → "This makes sense" → "I need this"
```

### BOFU (Decision)
```
Hesitation → Trust → Urgency
"Is it worth it?" → "Others got results" → "I should act now"
```

## Pacing Guidelines

| Duration | Words | Pace |
|----------|-------|------|
| 15s | 35-45 | Fast, punchy |
| 30s | 65-80 | Conversational |
| 45s | 100-120 | Room to breathe |
| 60s | 140-160 | Storytelling pace |

**Rule of thumb:** 2.5-3 words per second for natural delivery.
